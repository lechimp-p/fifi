# Fifi

**fifi** stands for *if this then if*. It is an attempt to clone basic
[IFTT](https://ifttt.com/) functionality and learn Elixir along the way.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `fifi` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:fifi, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

## Developing

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/fifi](https://hexdocs.pm/fifi).
