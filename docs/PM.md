# Project Managment

* In the master branch only editorial changes SHOULD be made directly.
* Non-editorial changes SHOULD be made via PRs.
* PRs SHOULD be reviewed by every contributor.
* Non-trivial changes SHOULD be discussed via GitHub issues before they are
  actually PRed.
* Non-trivial changes SHOULD be documented in architectural decision records
  (ADRs) in the repo.
